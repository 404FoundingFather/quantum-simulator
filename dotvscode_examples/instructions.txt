Depending on your system (Linux/Mac/Windows), create the .vscode directory
in the root of this project, and copy the platform specific files (i.e. mac/)
to the .vscode directory.

Currently, there are only mac examples.

Alternatively, you if using CoPilot in VS Code (in Agent mode), you could issue this prompt:

Setup visual debugging in VS Code.  Create the appropriate files in the .vscode directory for the [your OS] operating system.

example:

Setup visual debugging in VS Code.  Create the appropriate files in the .vscode directory for the Linux operating system.


note:  use Claude 3.7 Sonnet as the CoPilot model
