# Project Progress (Kanban Board)

**Last Updated:** April 24, 2025

## Backlog (To-Do)

### Phase 2 Tasks [P2]
- Implement checkpointing (`CheckpointSerializer`, `DataExporter`)
- Add integration tests and performance benchmarks
- Refine ImGui panels: graphs, tooltips, themes

## In Progress
- Integrate FFTW3 plans and OpenMP multi-threading — Eric Hammond
- Develop `SimulationEngine::step()` with SSFM algorithm — Eric Hammond

## Under Review
- Product Vision and Memory-Bank index updates — Pending peer review
- Technical Context and System Patterns documents — Pending peer review

## Completed
- Create `VisualizationEngine` for OpenGL rendering and GLSL shaders — Eric Hammond
- Build `UIManager` with ImGui widgets for controls and parameter inputs — Eric Hammond
- Write unit tests for core modules (Wavefunction, Potential, SimulationEngine) — Eric Hammond
- Implement `Potential` interface and concrete classes (Free Space, Barrier, Harmonic) — Eric Hammond
- Define `Wavefunction` class and Gaussian initialization — Eric Hammond
- Set up CMake dependencies (FFTW, OpenMP, GLFW, ImGui) — Eric Hammond
- Initialize project scaffold (src/, include/, tests/, memory-bank), basic CMakeLists.txt, README, and CI pipeline skeleton — Eric Hammond
- Resolve ImGui backend include path error (`imgui_impl_glfw.h` not found) — Eric Hammond
- Resolve build issues on MacOS and document requirements installation

## Blocked/Issues
- ⚠️ FFTW3 multi-threaded integration: waiting on compatible library version
- ⚠️ ImGui theme integration: need finalized color scheme and assets

## Notes
- Priority levels: [P1] High, [P2] Medium, [P3] Low
- Update Kanban when tasks move between columns to reflect status changes
